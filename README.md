# Jump Through Time
 Point of game is simple-jump unitl you get to portal to go to next level.
 * Each level will be in  different time zone-from dinosaurs all over to space traveling.
 * Character have blocks for jumping on top,where time portal is waiting for him.
 * If character fall on ground-game over.
 Of course,this is just first idea,there will be super powers which will help character to pass levels.
 Hope you will enjoy playing this :)
